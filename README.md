# "Table Talk" questions for software related organizations

This repository contains instructions and questions for a "Table Talk" training/workshop exercise format, with questions related to organizations/teams producing software.

[Training from the back of the room](https://fromthebackoftheroom.training/a-short-overview-of-training-from-the-back-of-the-room) is a [great book](https://www.amazon.com/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn/dp/0787996629) for trainer and facilitor. I use more and more of their advocated practices in my [software related trainings and workshops](https://domain-driven-design.eu/), so here I share the material of the exercise to warm-up such activies called "Table Talk". Feel free to use and contribute to the questions with a pull request.
The "Training from the back of the room" describe four key activites (the 4Cs) for an efficient learning experience:

1. "Connect" Making the Connections: activities arouse people to their interest and open up to learning.
2. "Concept" Explaining the Concepts: people encounter new knowledge or skills.
3. "Concrete Practice" Practicing the Skills: people practice the new skills using the concepts learned previously.
4. "Conclusions" Celebrating the Learning: people look back to their learning and practice to ensure the remembering and then concrete try out.

The "table talk" exercise belongs to the first activity "Connect - Making the Connections"

## Expected benefits of "Connect" activities

- **Connections with other learners** (in positive and meaningful ways that are relevant to the training topic)
- **Connections to the topic** (that is, to what they already know, or think they know, about the information to be learned)
- **Connections to learning objectives** (what they personally want to take away from the training)
- **Connections to personal goals** (what they will be able to do as a result of what they learn)

So enough talking, here are the instructions:

# "Table Talk" Warm-up Exercise Instructions

* Make groups of 3/4 persons from different teams/roles
* In each group pick 3 questions from the following list related to each people skills
* Take 5 minutes per question to:
   * Discuss the question with your table group
   * Make a one- or two-sentence summary of your discussions
* Reports your summary to the whole class
